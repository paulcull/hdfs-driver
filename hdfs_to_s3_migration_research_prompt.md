### **Research Prompt: Feasibility and Design of an HDFS-Compliant Storage Abstraction Layer for HDFS to S3 Migration**

**Objective:**

Conduct a thorough analysis and design study for the creation of an HDFS-compliant abstraction layer (wrapper). This layer will serve as an intermediary for applications currently using the HDFS protocol, enabling a seamless and gradual migration of data from an on-premise HDFS cluster to an S3 object store, facilitated by VAST Data appliances. The final output should be a comprehensive research document suitable for both technical and executive stakeholders.

**Context:**

We are migrating a large-scale data platform from a traditional HDFS infrastructure to a modern S3-based object storage solution. To minimize disruption to existing applications and data pipelines that are tightly coupled with the HDFS API, we are proposing an interim solution: an HDFS-compliant wrapper. This wrapper would intercept HDFS calls and, based on a configurable mapping, redirect them to either the legacy HDFS cluster or the new S3 object store. This will allow data subsets to be migrated incrementally without requiring immediate changes to the client applications.

**Key Research Areas and Deliverables:**

Please structure your research document to address the following sections in detail:

**1. Executive Summary:**
*   Provide a high-level overview of the problem, the proposed solution (the HDFS wrapper), and the key findings of the research.
*   Summarize the primary benefits (e.g., reduced risk, phased migration, application transparency) and potential drawbacks (e.g., performance overhead, maintenance cost).
*   Conclude with a clear recommendation on whether to proceed with building or implementing this solution.
*   This summary should be concise and tailored for a CIO/CTO-level audience, focusing on business impact, cost, and strategic alignment.

**2. Analysis of Existing Solutions:**
*   Investigate the market for off-the-shelf tools, open-source projects, or existing functionalities within the Hadoop ecosystem (e.g., Hadoop S3A connector, Alluxio, S3-compatible endpoints on storage appliances) that could fulfill the requirement for an HDFS abstraction layer.
*   For each identified solution, provide a detailed analysis covering:
    *   **Functionality:** How does it achieve HDFS protocol compatibility over S3?
    *   **Performance:** What is the expected performance overhead compared to native HDFS or S3 access?
    *   **Compatibility:** How well does it support the full HDFS API and Hadoop ecosystem tools (e.g., Spark, Hive, MapReduce)?
    *   **Maturity & Community:** How stable, well-documented, and actively maintained is the solution?
    *   **Cost:** What are the licensing, support, and operational costs?

**3. Custom Solution Design: HDFS-Compliant Wrapper**
*   If no existing solution is suitable, propose a detailed architectural design for a custom-built wrapper. The design should include:
    *   **Component Architecture:** A diagram and description of the key components (e.g., API Gateway, Routing/Mapping Engine, HDFS Connector, S3 Connector).
    *   **Routing Logic:** A detailed explanation of how the wrapper will determine whether to route a request to HDFS or S3. This should cover metadata management, path-based routing, and the mechanism for updating the routing map as data is migrated.
    *   **API Translation:** A plan for translating HDFS API calls (e.g., `open`, `create`, `listStatus`, `rename`) and their semantics (e.g., atomic renames, directory structures) to equivalent S3 API operations. Address potential challenges, such as emulating HDFS's directory hierarchy on S3's flat object structure.
    *   **Authentication & Security:** How will the wrapper handle authentication (e.g., Kerberos) and translate security principles between the two systems?
    *   **Performance Considerations:** Strategies for optimizing performance and minimizing latency, including caching, connection pooling, and multipart uploads/downloads for S3.
    *   **Technology Stack:** Recommendations for programming languages, frameworks, and libraries to be used in development.

**4. Pros and Cons Analysis:**
*   Provide a balanced analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of implementing the proposed HDFS wrapper solution, comparing it against the alternative of a "big bang" migration where all applications are refactored at once.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Phased, controlled migration with reduced risk.
    *   Application transparency and minimal immediate refactoring effort.
    *   Ability to run in a hybrid mode for an extended period.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Potential performance overhead and single point of failure.
    *   Development and maintenance cost of the wrapper itself.
    *   Complexity in perfectly emulating all HDFS semantics on S3.
    *   Risk of the "temporary" solution becoming permanent.

**5. Implementation & Migration Plan:**
*   Outline a high-level project plan for developing and deploying the wrapper.
*   Describe a phased migration strategy, detailing how data and applications would be moved from HDFS to S3 using the wrapper.
*   Define key metrics for success and a testing strategy to validate the wrapper's functionality and performance.
